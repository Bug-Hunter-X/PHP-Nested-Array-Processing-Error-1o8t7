This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP when processing nested arrays: failure to correctly handle specific conditions within the nested structure.  The `bug.php` file shows the erroneous code, which omits error strings from the final result. The solution, in `bugSolution.php`, addresses this by correctly appending error strings to the result array. This example is particularly useful for those learning about array recursion and error handling in PHP.
